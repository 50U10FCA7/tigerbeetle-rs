`tigerbeetle-unofficial`
========================

Unofficial [TigerBeetle] bindings for [Rust].




## Status

Because this [TigerBeetle] client library implementation is not a part of the [official `tigerbeetle` repos][1], it is hard to ensure and keep some of [Rust] safety guarantees from the outside. For that reason I invite people to contribute to this repo or finally develop the official [Rust] client library.




## Repo Overview

The repository hosts the following libraries:

 * [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tigerbeetle-unofficial.svg?label=tigerbeetle-unofficial)](https://crates.io/crates/tigerbeetle-unofficial)
   [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tigerbeetle-unofficial/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tigerbeetle-unofficial) - Safe high-level async bindings. Implemented with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` upon `tigerbeetle-unofficial-core`.
 * [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tigerbeetle-unofficial-core.svg?label=tigerbeetle-unofficial-core)](https://crates.io/crates/tigerbeetle-unofficial-core)
   [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tigerbeetle-unofficial-core/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tigerbeetle-unofficial-core) - Safe low-level callback-based async bindings.
 * [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tigerbeetle-unofficial-sys.svg?label=tigerbeetle-unofficial-sys)](https://crates.io/crates/tigerbeetle-unofficial-sys)
